# Transformice Ultimate Team (TUT) 2020

This is a web application based off of FIFA's Ultimate Team (FUT) where your goal is to build the best team (draft) possible from virtual cards. But rather than players from soccer, these are players from the mouse game [Transformice](https://www.transformice.com/) (TFM).

## Mechanics

In order to quantify what is the "best" draft, two mechanics are in the game; Chemistry and Rating. Both equal up to 100 points, which will combine to make a grand total of 200 points available.

### Chemistry

Chemistry is determined by how different cards link up with each other, both from where the cards' location statistics (`Main Server` and `Living Continent`) and their `Personality Influence`.

### Rating

Rating is aggregated from all the cards' individual `Rating` in the draft. Therefore the best draft is created through the combination of the highest rated cards and how they all synergize together through Chemistry.
