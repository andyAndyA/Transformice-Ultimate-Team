This directory contains all utility files used for the main TUT code.

#### tut

This is the main TUT required utilities for the game. These are just hosted in this directory to prevent overcrowding the master `../` directory.

#### p5

If you are developing or playing for the first time, please download and unzip the [p5.js complete](https://p5js.org/download/) files here. This is a required dependency to compile the game.

The following file hierarchy should be imported like so;

```
p5
│   p5.js
│   p5.min.js    
│
└───addons
    │   p5.sound.js
    │   p5.sound.min.js
```
